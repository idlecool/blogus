	<p class="title">Why google don't publish their pagerank</p>
	<p>Google will occasionally offer clues on its blog and in other places as to how it ranks sites. PageRank is one well known tool it uses, but it has been coming under increased criticism lately. Some sites have even sued Google for receiving a low PageRank!</p>
	<p>Because Google is paranoid about SEO experts trying to game its ratings, it tends to be highly secretive about how it ranks sites. Therefore, Google will not provide a whole lot of information as to how to optimize your own site to get higher rankings. Google won’t even display all of the links it has identified to your site. It does, however, provide the PageRank indicator.</p>
	<p>At one time, you could only view a site’s PageRank by downloading the Google Toolbar (which is available only for Internet Explorer and Firefox). Today, plug-ins for other browsers can provide the same information. For example, Safari PageRank puts a tag displaying the page’s ranking in the upper right-hand corner of every webpage viewed on Apple’s popular browser.</p>
	<p>Although a PageRank indicator was added to the Google Toolbar back in December of 2000, Google is downplaying displaying a publicly visible PageRank today so as to discourage tricks, such as content farming, used to manipulate the results.</p>
	<p>Google apparently feels that a prominent PageRank indicator could give visitors a false impression as to the quality of a site. According to Google, “We’ve been telling people for a long time that they shouldn’t focus on PageRank so much; many site owners seem to think it’s the most important metric for them to track, which is simply not true.” According to Wikipedia, Google uses over 200 methods to determine a site’s importance.</p>
	<p>Google periodically updates its PageRank and other ranking algorithms. For example, a recent change in June of 2010 resulted in a higher ranking for some sites and a lower one for others.</p>
	<p>The upshot of all this is that Google PageRank, like Alexa’s rankings, can be viewed only as a very rough guide of a site’s popularity and not much more.</p>
